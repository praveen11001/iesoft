question 2 : 
String Challenge
Have the function StringChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the Run-length encoding algorithm. This algorithm works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with a single character of the repeating sequence. For example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p. The string will not contain any numbers, punctuation, or symbols.
Once your function is working, take the final output string and concatenate it with your ChallengeToken, and then replace every fourth character with an underscore.

Your ChallengeToken: joev4ksqa7
Examples
Input: "aabbcde"
Output: 2a2b1c1d1e
Final Output: 2a2_1c1_1ej_ev4_sqa_
Input: "wwwbbbw"
Output: 3w3b1w
Final Output: 3w3_1wj_ev4_sqa_

Question 1 : 
String Challenge
Have the function StringChallenge(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the longest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty. Words may also contain numbers, for example "Hello world123 567"
Once your function is working, take the final output string and concatenate it with your ChallengeToken, and then replace every fourth character with an underscore.

Your ChallengeToken: joev4ksqa7
Examples
Input: "fun&!! time"
Output: time
Final Output: tim_joe_4ks_a7
Input: "I love dogs"
Output: love
Final Output: lov_joe_4ks_a7
